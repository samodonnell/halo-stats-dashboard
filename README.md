# Halo Stats Dashboard

[Live demo here.](https://floating-headland-42122.herokuapp.com/)

Small app which allows the user to look up player stats from Halo : MCC on the PC.

Built using Node and Express, utilising the [Halo API from Autocode](https://autocode.com/stdlib/halo/mcc/).

### Future Versions

Currently the player search will return results across all games from the collection. In the future I plan on making a filter for each game, as well as a comparison tool that allows the user to compare stats for two players.
